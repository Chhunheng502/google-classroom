# Google Classroom

This project is a clone to google official website [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com). The project is created for the purpose of implementing TDD (Test Driven Development) and applying some design principles I have learned so far. I'm also eager to implement Google Classroom features as well since I believe it's the best project to hone my skills further.
